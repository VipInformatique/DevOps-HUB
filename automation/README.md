# ⚙️ Automation & Pipelines

This section contains **automation scripts** that I use and share, including:

- **Jenkins Pipelines** — for CI/CD, container management, and infrastructure tasks.
- **GitHub Actions** — for automation directly in GitHub repositories.
- **Ansible Playbooks** — for provisioning and configuration management.
- **Shell Scripts** — for various automation tasks.
